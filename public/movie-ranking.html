<h1> The Best Movies According to Audrey</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Intouchables</h3>
<p> This is my favourite film of all-time. A beautiful story about friendship and pain and with elements of poverty and racism.</p>
<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p>This is my go-to when I need something exciting and riveting but easy to watch. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a knockout in this film.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p> This is a classic with great cinematography and writing.</p>
